## Usage

This color-coded **day planner** web application uses JavaScript code to turn the current hour on the planner red, the future hour to green, and all previous hours are set to grey. The goal was to save the user inputs into local storage in case the user accidentally closed the tab and lost their progress. The local storage saves these user inputs to solve that problem. At the top of the web application, there is also a standard date on display for the current day.
